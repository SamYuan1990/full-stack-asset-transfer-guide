# Workshop

**AIM:** To show a full end-to-end development of a solution on the Hyperledger Fabric Platform
**OBJECTIVES:** 

- Show how a Asset Transfer solution can be modelled and take advantage of a blockchains qualitites of service.
- Show how a Hyperledger Fabric network can be created via automation in K8S
	- Showing how the Fabric Operator and Console can be installed via Ansible playbooks
	- Show how a multi-organization configuration of Fabric can be created
- Show how for an Asset Transfer solution a Smart Contract can be written to support the business logic
	- Show how this can be developed iteratively to get correct function in a development context
	- Show how this can be then deployed to a production-class environment
- Show how client applications can be written using the Gateway functionality
	- Demonstrate how the simplification of the Gateway makes connecting applications more streamlined
	- Show how this streamlined approach improves resilience and availability
- Show how the tooling around Fabric can be used to improve the experience.

## Scenario

....

## Breakdown of Components needed

- Contract
- Network
- Client applications

## Smart Contract Developing

- write contract
- test deployment
- iterate on changes to confirm function

## Write Application Code

- client sdks for both parties working with assets
- how these can be written and debugged

## Deploy to production-grade

- Start KIND
- Add the Operator/Console
- Create network

## Operate

- Deploy Contracts & explain K8S Builder
- Connect Applications ..
